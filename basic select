SELECT city, state
FROM station


##[Weather Observation Station 2](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-2/)
Query the following two values from the STATION table:
1) The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of decimal places.
2) The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of decimal places.
![Station.jpg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/9336/1449345840-5f0a551030-Station.jpg)

SELECT city, LENGTH (city)
FROM station
ORDER BY LENGTH(city) ASC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT city, LENGTH(city)
FROM station
ORDER BY LENGTH(city) DESC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1
